# Hello, I'm Riya Sharma

I'm Learning **WEB DEVELOPMENT** with **GenAi**

I am currently pursuing **BCA (Online)** from **Amity University, Noida**.  
I have learned **HTML5** and **CSS3**, and I am now learning **JavaScript**.

I built a project called **Restaurant Menu Page** using **HTML** and **CSS**,  
and I plan to add **JavaScript** functionality to it in the future.
